# collaborativeFilter
Program calculates the pearson coeffecient and adjusted cosine for the user based collaborative filtering  and item based collaborative filtering for the recommendation systems to predict the rating of the items which helps to  get based on raking top k items to recommend to customer in e-commerce.


Recommendation system is highly used in e-commerce to recommend products based on the previous behaviour of the user and also address long tail problem.
Long tail problem where if recommendation system just recommends the items similar to users interest and also most solved or most rated items then the items in long end of tail 
which are less rated but has high returns will never be recommended to the user. So a good recommender system should recommend similar items and also keep recommendations diverse enough so gives user chance to explore and also address long tail problems.
